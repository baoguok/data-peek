## Tab Management

Navigate and manage query tabs without using the mouse.

| `Cmd/Ctrl + W` | Close current tab |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + 1-9` | Switch to tab 1-9 |

## Query Editor

Execute, format, and manage your SQL queries.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Execute current query |

### Monaco Editor Shortcuts

The query editor uses Monaco (the VS Code editor), so standard editor shortcuts work:

## Result Grid

Navigate query results entirely from the keyboard. The grid activates when virtualization kicks in (result row count > 50); smaller results use native browser focus.

### Cell Navigation

|----------|--------|
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Move focus between cells |
| `Home` | First cell in the current row |
| `End` | Last cell in the current row |

| `Cmd/Ctrl + End` | Last cell of the result |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Jump 20 rows |
| `Click` | Focus the clicked cell |

### Cell Inspector

Press `Enter` on a focused cell to open the inspector. It shows the full untruncated value, column type, char/byte counts, and a follow-foreign-key action when available.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Open the inspector for the focused cell |
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Scrub between cells while the inspector is open |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + C` | Copy the focused cell's value |
| `Escape` | Close the inspector and return focus to the grid |

## Tips for Mouseless Workflow

### 1. Use the Command Palette

`Cmd/Ctrl + K` is your best friend. It provides fuzzy search access to:
- All commands
- Connections
- Saved queries
- Theme switching
- Settings

### 2. Tab Navigation Pattern

A typical workflow:
1. `Cmd/Ctrl + T` - New tab
2. Type your query
3. `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` - Execute
4. Review results
5. `Cmd/Ctrl + W` - Close tab when done

### 3. Data Editing Pattern

1. Click a table in the sidebar
2. Click any cell to enter edit mode
3. Make your changes (arrow keys, Tab, Enter)
4. `Cmd/Ctrl + S` - Save all changes
5. `Escape` - Exit edit mode

### 4. Connection Switching

For projects with multiple databases:
- Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 1-9` for quick switching
- Or `Cmd/Ctrl + P` to search connections by name

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Uses `Cmd` (⌘) as the primary modifier
- `Ctrl` key is reserved for system shortcuts
- `Option` (⌥) used for alternate actions

### Windows / Linux

- Uses `Ctrl` as the primary modifier
- `Alt` used for alternate actions
- Window management shortcuts may conflict with system shortcuts

---

## Customizing Shortcuts

Currently, keyboard shortcuts are not customizable. This feature is planned for a future release.

If you have specific shortcut requests, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Rohithgilla12/data-peek/issues).

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcuts Not Working?

1. **Check focus** - Make sure data-peek is the active window
2. **Check context** - Some shortcuts only work in specific contexts (e.g., edit mode)
3. **Check for conflicts** - Other apps or system shortcuts may intercept keys
4. **Check the menu bar** - The menu shows available shortcuts and their current state

### Monaco Editor Shortcuts Conflicting?

The SQL editor (Monaco) has its own shortcuts that take priority when the editor is focused. If you need to trigger an app shortcut while editing:
1. Click outside the editor first
2. Or use the menu bar
