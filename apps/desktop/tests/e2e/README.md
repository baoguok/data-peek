# End-to-end tests

Playwright-driven tests against the real built Electron app. The fixtures in
`fixtures/electron-app.ts` boot `out/main/index.js` for each test with an isolated
`--user-data-dir`, so persisted state (connections, pinned tabs, query history,
license activation, schema cache) does not bleed between specs.

## Run

```bash
# From apps/desktop:
pnpm test:e2e          # build + run headlessly
pnpm test:e2e:ui       # build + run in Playwright's UI mode (best for authoring)
pnpm test:e2e:debug    # build + run with PWDEBUG=1 (inspector + breakpoints)
```

The `pnpm build` step is wired into the npm scripts so the bundle in `out/` is
always fresh. If you want to skip the build (e.g. iterating on a test against an
already-built bundle), invoke Playwright directly:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test
```

## Adding a test

1. Drop a new `*.spec.ts` in `tests/e2e/`.
2. Import `{ test, expect }` from `./fixtures/electron-app` (NOT from `@playwright/test` —
   the local `test` is the extended one with the `electronApp` / `window` / `userDataDir`
   fixtures).
3. Use `electronApp.evaluate` for main-process introspection, and the `window` Page for
   renderer interactions.

```ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures/electron-app'

test('my new behaviour', async ({ window }) => {
  await window.locator('button:has-text("New Query")').click()
  await expect(window.locator('.monaco-editor')).toBeVisible()
})
```

## Database-touching tests

`fixtures/postgres.ts` spins up a Postgres container via
[testcontainers-node](https://node.testcontainers.org/) and loads
`seeds/acme_saas_seed.sql` via the postgres image's `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`
hook. Use it in a spec via `test.beforeAll` so the container is shared across the
file's tests:

```ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures/electron-app'
import { startSeededPostgres, type SeededPostgres } from './fixtures/postgres'

let pg: SeededPostgres

test.beforeAll(async () => {
  pg = await startSeededPostgres()
})

test.afterAll(async () => {
  await pg?.stop()
})

test.beforeEach(async ({ window }) => {
  // Each test gets a fresh userData (fixture default), so re-seed the connection.
  await window.evaluate((cfg) => window.api.connections.add(cfg), pg.config)
})

test('selects against the seed', async ({ window }) => {
  const result = await window.evaluate(
    (cfg) => window.api.db.query(cfg, 'SELECT count(*) FROM users'),
    pg.config
  )
  expect(result.success).toBe(true)
})
```

The container image is pinned to `postgres:16-alpine` so behaviour doesn't drift
on a Postgres minor bump. Container lifetime is bounded by the testcontainers Ryuk
reaper, so even if a test crashes mid-run the container is reaped within seconds.

Requirements:

- Docker available locally (Docker Desktop or OrbStack on macOS, Docker Engine on Linux).
- Existing tests assume the seed file at `seeds/acme_saas_seed.sql` is unchanged. If
  the seed grows or shrinks, update the assertions in `queries.spec.ts`.

## Live BYOH harness checks (opt-in)

`byoh-harness-live.spec.ts` covers the bring-your-own-harness providers end to end:
CLI detection, grounded vs schema-only chat, the capability refusals, and the
provider-switch session reset. It spawns the **real** `claude` / `codex` / `agy`
CLIs, so it is gated and skipped by default:

```bash
BYOH_LIVE=1 pnpm exec playwright test byoh-harness-live --workers=1
```

Requirements beyond the usual (Docker + a built bundle):

- All three CLIs installed **and signed in** — the adapters deliberately drop
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the child env, so an
  env var is not a substitute for the CLI's own auth.
- Real model round-trips: budget ~3 minutes and your own subscription quota. Timeouts
  are raised to 300s per test because agentic turns dwarf the 60s default.

CI never runs it (no CLIs, signed in or otherwise), which is the point of the gate —
the adapters' deterministic coverage lives in `src/main/harness/__tests__/` and runs
from captured CLI fixtures instead.

MCP ports are set explicitly per test (`47241`+) rather than using the `4722` default,
for the same reason `mcp-server.spec.ts` does it: a locally running data-peek usually
holds 4722, and `mcp.setEnabled(true)` rejects on a busy port instead of falling back.

## CI

`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs the suite on every PR and on `main`. The runner
is `ubuntu-latest` (Docker preinstalled) with `xvfb-run` for the virtual display.
On failure, the Playwright HTML report and `test-results/` artefacts are uploaded
for 7 days.

`TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true` is set in CI because the runner is torn down
per job anyway; this avoids the Ryuk image pull and a small startup cost.

To add macOS to the matrix later, no extra setup is needed (Docker is available
via runner-installed orbstack/docker desktop, and macOS Electron doesn't need
xvfb) — but macOS runner minutes are 10x Linux's, so the current single-OS
setup is intentional.
