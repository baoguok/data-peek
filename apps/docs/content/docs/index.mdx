## What data-peek is NOT

To set clear expectations:

- **Not a database admin tool** — Focus is on querying and exploring, not server management
- **Not a data migration tool** — No import/export of entire databases
- **Not enterprise software** — Built for individual developers

## License

data-peek is **free for personal use** with all features unlocked. A [Pro license](/docs/configuration/licensing) is required for commercial use at for-profit organizations.
