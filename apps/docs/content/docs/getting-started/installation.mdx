Run this command in Terminal:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/data-peek.app
```

### Linux: AppImage won't run

Make sure you have FUSE installed:
```bash
sudo apt install fuse libfuse2  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install fuse           # Fedora
```

### Windows: Antivirus blocks installation

Some antivirus software may flag the installer. Add an exception for data-peek or temporarily disable real-time protection during installation.
