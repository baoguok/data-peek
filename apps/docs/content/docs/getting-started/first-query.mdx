# First Query

Now that you're connected to a database, let's run your first query!

## Running a Query

1. **Open a new tab** by clicking the **+** button in the tab bar or pressing `Cmd+T` (macOS) or `Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux)

2. **Type your query** in the editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Execute the query** by pressing `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux)

4. **View the results** in the table below the editor

<Callout type="tip">
  The results show the first 100 rows by default. Use the pagination controls at the bottom to navigate through larger result sets.
</Callout>

## Quick Table Preview

Instead of writing a query, you can quickly preview any table:

1. **Expand your connection** in the sidebar to see schemas and tables
2. **Click on a table name** to open a preview tab
3. data-peek automatically runs `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 100`

## Understanding the Results

### Results Toolbar

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Row count** | Shows number of rows returned |
| **Duration** | Query execution time in milliseconds |
| **Export** | Download results as CSV or JSON |
| **Edit** | Enable inline data editing |

### Data Type Indicators

Columns show colored badges indicating their data type:

| Color | Types |
|-------|-------|
| 🟣 Purple | UUID |
| 🟢 Green | Text, VARCHAR |
| 🔵 Blue | Integer, Numeric |
| 🟠 Orange | Date, Timestamp |
| 🟡 Yellow | Boolean |

### NULL Values

NULL values are displayed with a distinctive `NULL` badge to clearly distinguish them from empty strings.

## Working with Results

### Copy Cell Value

Click any cell to copy its value to the clipboard.

### Copy Row as JSON

Right-click a row and select **Copy as JSON** to get the entire row as a JSON object.

### Navigate Foreign Keys

If a column is a foreign key, you can `Cmd+Click` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Click` (Windows/Linux) to open the referenced record in a new tab.

## Query Editor Features

### Syntax Highlighting

The Monaco-powered editor provides full SQL syntax highlighting and IntelliSense.

### Format SQL

Press `Cmd+Shift+F` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) to auto-format your SQL query.

### Multiple Tabs

Open multiple query tabs to work on different queries simultaneously. Each tab maintains its own:
- Query text
- Results
- Pagination state
- Execution history

## Query History

Every query you run is automatically saved to history. Access it from the sidebar to:

- Re-run previous queries
- See execution times and row counts
- Delete old queries
- Search through your history

## Saving Queries

Bookmark frequently used queries:

1. Write your query
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+S` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Windows/Linux)
3. Give it a name, description, and optional tags
4. Access saved queries from the sidebar
