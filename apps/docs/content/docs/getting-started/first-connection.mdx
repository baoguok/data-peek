# First Connection

Let's connect data-peek to your database. This guide uses PostgreSQL, but the process is similar for MySQL.

## Adding a Connection

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar under "Connections"
2. Fill in your connection details:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | A friendly name for this connection | `Local Dev` |
| **Host** | Database server hostname or IP | `localhost` |
| **Port** | Database port | `5432` (PostgreSQL) or `3306` (MySQL) |
| **Database** | Database name | `myapp_development` |
| **User** | Database username | `postgres` |
| **Password** | Database password | `••••••••` |

3. Click **Test Connection** to verify your settings
4. Click **Save** to add the connection

<Callout type="tip">
  You can also paste a connection string directly. data-peek will auto-fill all fields from URLs like:
  ```
  postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database
  ```
</Callout>

## Connection String Format

### PostgreSQL

```
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=[mode]
```

### MySQL

```
mysql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]
```

## SSL/TLS Connections

For secure connections to cloud databases:

1. Check the **SSL** option when adding your connection
2. For services like Supabase, Railway, or Neon, SSL is usually required

<Callout type="warning">
  Always use SSL when connecting to production databases over the internet.
</Callout>

## Managing Connections

### Editing a Connection

1. Right-click the connection in the sidebar
2. Select **Edit**
3. Modify the details and save

### Deleting a Connection

1. Right-click the connection in the sidebar
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

### Switching Connections

- Click on any connection in the sidebar to switch to it
- Use `Cmd+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the connection picker
- Use `Cmd+Shift+1-9` to quickly switch between connections 1-9

## Connection Status

The connection indicator shows:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 Green | Connected and ready |
| 🟡 Yellow | Connecting... |
| 🔴 Red | Connection error |
