# Query Editor

data-peek's query editor is powered by Monaco, the same editor engine used in VS Code. It provides a powerful, familiar environment for writing SQL.

## Editor Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Full SQL syntax highlighting with support for:
- Keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.)
- Functions (COUNT, SUM, NOW, etc.)
- Strings, numbers, and operators
- Comments (single-line and multi-line)

### Auto-Completion

As you type, the editor suggests:
- SQL keywords
- Table and column names (schema-aware)
- Function names
- Snippets for common patterns

<Callout type="tip">
  Press `Ctrl+Space` to manually trigger auto-completion suggestions.
</Callout>

### SQL Formatting

Auto-format your SQL for better readability:

- **Shortcut:** `Cmd+Shift+F` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux)
- **Menu:** View → Format SQL

Before:
```sql
select id,name,email from users where created_at>'2024-01-01' order by name
```

After:
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  email
FROM
  users
WHERE
  created_at > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY
  name
```

## Executing Queries

### Run Current Query

- **Shortcut:** `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux)
- Executes the query in the editor
- Results appear below the editor

### Multiple Statements

If your editor contains multiple SQL statements, data-peek executes them all sequentially. Results from each statement are combined.

<Callout type="warning">
  For safety, only SELECT statements return visible results. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements report affected row counts.
</Callout>

## Tab Management

### Creating Tabs

- Click the **+** button in the tab bar
- Press `Cmd+T` (macOS) or `Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux)
- Click a table in the sidebar to open a preview tab

### Tab Types

| Tab Type | Icon | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Query | 📝 | Custom SQL query |
| Table Preview | 📊 | Auto-generated SELECT from table |
| ERD | 🔗 | Entity relationship diagram |
| Table Designer | 🛠 | Create/edit table structure |

### Tab Actions

Right-click a tab to:
- **Close** - Close this tab
- **Close Others** - Close all except this tab
- **Close to Right** - Close tabs to the right
- **Rename** - Give the tab a custom name
- **Pin** - Keep tab open permanently

### Tab Ordering

Drag and drop tabs to reorder them. Pinned tabs stay on the left.

### Switching Tabs

- Click on a tab
- Use `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+9` to switch to tabs 1-9
- Use `Cmd+Option+→` / `Cmd+Option+←` to navigate between tabs

## Query History

Every executed query is saved to history:

1. Open the **History** panel in the sidebar
2. See all previous queries with:
   - Timestamp
   - Execution duration
   - Row count
   - Success/error status
3. Click a history item to load it into a new tab

<Callout type="info">
  History is stored locally and persists across app restarts. The last 100 queries are kept.
</Callout>

## Editor Preferences

Customize the editor in Settings:

- **Hide Query Editor by Default** - Start table preview tabs with editor collapsed
- More customization options coming soon
